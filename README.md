# NHS Performance Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for visualizing NHS performance metrics across England.  
The project combines datasets such as referral-to-treatment waiting times, A&E admissions, avoidable mortality, and population deprivation levels to support data-driven insights.

The dashboard is currently in development. Initial stages involve dataset review, cleaning, and setting up the application structure.
